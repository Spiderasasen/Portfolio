# Portfolio
This is where i will post all projects that I'm proud of and also am not afraid to show to the public. 

# Some Items
This will include linkers to all projects, no matter the language. so if the langauge is in Python, and the user selects the project they want from it, the computer will get a python to html/css/js linker that will show the user the code in a new window. Making some of the code that i have done, which is mainly console log status, a chance to be seen by the world

# BUT WHAT IF THE PROJECT IS A WEBSITE!!!!!!!!!!!
That's simple, my friend, it will, it will go to the website in question when the user clicks on the project

# So anything advanced?
Yes! There will be a bunch of more advanced features that will look more and more advanced than i anticipated. So yes, i might need some help with that from someone, but I'll be fine. 

# TODO on GitHub?
This project will always be in the TODO section of my GitHub page, since I keep getting more and more projects.
