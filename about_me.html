        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello, My Name is Diego Diaz, I'm from Burlington, NC, and I'm a CS student at Elon University with a Minor in German.
            <br>
            <br>
            I have experience with web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), Python, Java, SQL, Rust, and I’m currently learning Kotlin.
            <br>
            <br>
            Python has been my go-to language for building projects such as an encryption/decryption system, an algorithm visualizer, and tools to support my coursework. With Java, I’ve developed interactive applications, including a mini programming lounge in WWC using JFrame to encourage collaborative learning. On the web side, I’ve built a metric and currency converter and even recreated the original ARG website for The Blair Witch Project.
            <br>
            <br>
            I’m dedicated to programming and thrive on seeing projects through to completion with polish and precision. When I get hooked on an idea, I make sure to finish it to perfection.
