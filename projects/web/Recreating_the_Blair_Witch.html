            <p>In this project, I have created a replica of the infamous Blair Witch ARG. With the idea of having to try to bring back those scary moments that people might have had back then. This reaction is not only a 1-1 recreation for but it also includes a new mini story in the inclusion. The project has the 3 main languages to create a website. With the HTML using new elements to me, like mapping, to the CSS making me fall in love with hovering elements(for as they are sometimes really helpful for buttons or anything that the console log might not tell you if something is wrong visually), and finally with JavaScript that actually helps me get a better understanding of this confusing language. Honestly, working on this project only made me enjoy programming and also finishing it, for it helped me learn a lot from it.</p>
