    <div class="description">
        <p>This was one of the very first projects I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It’s simple, but I keep it here because it highlights how far I’ve come as a developer. Back then, my code had little variation in style and structure — now I’m building more advanced systems with confidence.
            <br>
            Like many developers, I’ve used AI tools along the way, but this project taught me the importance of understanding and correcting mistakes instead of relying blindly on generated code. From catching duplicated logic to experimenting with code I didn’t fully understand at first, this project gave me the confidence to explore, make changes, and learn through trial and error. It marks the start of my journey toward becoming a more capable and self‑reliant programmer.
