            <p>This project pushed me deeper into JavaScript than I expected — honestly, it’s more JS than I thought I’d be writing at the time. The goal was simple: build a converter that handles multiple tasks, including switching between the American imperial system and metric, converting Celsius to Fahrenheit, and calculating currency exchange rates based on the country selected.
                <br>
                Originally, I wanted to integrate a live API for real‑time exchange rates, but I couldn’t get it working without breaking the rest of my code. Instead, I used the exchange rate data available in August 2025 as a static reference. It’s not perfect, but it gave me a solid foundation for understanding how JavaScript handles logic and user input. More importantly, it marked one of my first real steps into JS programming — and helped me appreciate how even simple projects can teach a lot.
