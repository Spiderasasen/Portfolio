            <p>This project had me looking at a lot of JS code. To the point that it's more JS than it should be. Imma be honest, the code is simple because this is when i began actually looking at coding in JS. While yes, the main purpose is to convert from the American imperial system to metric, C to F, and also to convert different currencies depending on the country the user selected. While yes, the original idea was to go through and call an api that will calculate the correct data, i couldn't find a way to get it correct without breaking the code i had. So instead, I got the current exchange rate for the time, I guess, from August of 2025. So it's not perfect, but it helps me get a better understanding of how coding in JS would be.</p>
