        <p>Blackjack? Again? Why not. For me, learning a new language isn’t about writing “Hello World” — that’s too shallow. Unless you’re tackling something extreme like BrainFuck, ARM Assembly, or Binary, you don’t really get the fundamentals that way. So I built a simple blackjack game in Rust. It’s not the kind of project Rust was designed for — it’s a high‑level systems language, not meant for small toy programs — but that’s exactly why it was interesting. Coding blackjack forced me to actually engage with Rust’s syntax and rules, and it helped me decide whether this is a language I want to stick with. I might return to Rust later, but for now, this project gave me the hands‑on experience I needed.</p>
