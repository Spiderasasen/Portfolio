        <p>This is the original code I’m always excited to talk about when Java comes up. Honestly, it’s not great — I wrote it back in high school when I was just starting to fall in love with programming. It’s a modified Oregon Trail‑style game that often breaks, but I don’t care. I love this project because it pushed me deeper into programming: debugging, hoping things would work, and celebrating when they did. It gave me so many good memories and really cemented my passion for coding.</p>
